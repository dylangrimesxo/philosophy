All the following points should be read as “to the best of our knowledge”. We are not website experts, so w can’t vouch for how this website is actually implemented. We can only tell you about our intentions.

## Collection of your personal information
Nothing on this website requires you to identify yourself. The only personal information collected while you visit this site is non-identifying information, such as browser type and operating system.

We have set the **[Hugo GDPR options](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/#all-privacy-settings)** so that your IP address is anonymised within **Google Analytics** and the **“Do Not Track”** request is respected.

## Sharing of your personal information

**Google Analytics** does collect some information about you. See the **[Google Analytics privacy page](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245).**

## Use of your personal information
